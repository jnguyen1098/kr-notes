# Exercise 1 - 1

> Run the \`\``hello, world`'' program on your system. Experiment with leaving
out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.

Literally just "hello, world".

This book was published some decades ago, so the syntax for the program is
somewhat dated. As a result, today's compilers will likely throw a warning
about the `main()` declaration "defaulting to `int`". This was because back in
the day, functions didn't necessarily need to include a declaration that they
returned `int`, as that was the assumed behaviour.

Also included is a modern-day version of this program. In this version, the
distinction between a function that takes in an "unspecified number of
arguments" and one that takes in "no arguments" rears its head. To maintain
compatibility, C still allows declaring functions as `func()`, however what
people don't realize is that the absence of `void` doesn't make the function
`void`â€”it really means the number of arguments taken in isn't specified,
essentially allowing a caller to put in any arbitrary number of arguments
without any use.

Taking a look at some modern languages like C++ and Java, we see that the
syntax for `(void)` is that of `()`.

Other changes in the modern-day version are:
+ Unifying the three `printf` statements into a single call
+ Explicitly `return`ing a value in `main()`

If you compile this program under `-ansi`, `-std=c89`, or `-std=c90`, you get
undefined behaviour on exit: the lack of `return` statement at the end of main
is required in these standards (though as of C99 it is no longer a thing)...

If you run this program and then run `echo "$?"`, you might get any value.
In my particular case, I got a return value of 37.
